Java Collection Framework
--------------------------
	- The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.
	- It can be divided into 2 parts:
		1) Implementation of Data Structures
			a) List 	: Arraylist, Linkedlist, Vector, Stack
				- Vector and stack are thread safe legacy classes. Not recomended to use in single thread applications. Use ArrayList instead of Vector and Use ArrayDeque instead of stack.
				
			b) Set		: Hashset, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
				- Set is collection of unique keys means not duplicate keys
				- The objects that we insert into the HashSet do not guarantee to be inserted in the same order. The objects are inserted based on their hashcode.
				- HashSet internally implements hashing; TreeSet implements self balancing binary search tree(red-black tree)
				- LinkedHashSet - A LinkedHashSet is very similar to a HashSet. The difference is that this uses a doubly linked list to store the data and retains the ordering of the elements.
				- In TreeSet, item should be comparable to keep item in sorted order.
				
			c) Queue	: Linkedlist, ArrayDeque, PriorityQueue
				- ArrayDeque class which is implemented in the collection framework provides us with a way to apply resizable-array. This is a special kind of array that grows and allows users to add or remove an element from both sides of the queue.
				- The PriorityQueue is based on the priority heap. It is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on priority.
				
			d) Deque	: Linkedlist, ArrayDeque
				- Deque means doubly ended queue, is a data structure where we can add and remove the elements from both the ends of the queue. This interface extends the queue interface. Additional functions like offerFirst(), offerLast(), pollFirst(), pollLast() etc. 
				
			e) Map		: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap
				- Map is collection of key-value pairs.
				- Functions like containsKey(), containsValue().
			
			Note: 
				1) LinkedList can be used as DoublyLinkedList, Queue and stack
				2) All these collections and interfaces do not support primitive types for eg, int, char etc. However, they all support the non-primitive types like the Integer, Character etc called the Wrapper classes. Its advantage is that on the failure of operation instead of throwing errors the non-primitive types return a Null value.
			
		2) Implementation of Basic Algorithms
			- Collections class
				- binarySearch(), sort(), max(), min(), reverse(), fill(), shuffle()..
				
Generic In Java
---------------
	- The generic classes can only be used for Non-primitive types and wrapper classes. Here are the major advantages of Generics in Java:
		1) Write once, use for nay non-primitive types.
		2) Java Collection extensively use Generics
		3) Generic class/interface and methods
		4) Type safety: Get compile time errors instead of runtime
	
			//Generic Class
			claass MyGen<T>
			{
				T x;
				static int count;
				MyGen() {
					count++;
				}
			}
		
			class Test
			{
				//Generic Method
				public static <T> int count(T arr[], T num)
				{
					int res =0;
					for(T e : arr){
						if(e.equals(num))
							res++;
					}
					return res;
				}
				
				public static void min(String args[]){
				
					Integer arr[] = {10, 20, 30,40, 10};
					System.out.println(count(arr,10)); //2
					
					MyGen<Integer> m1 = new MyGen<>();
					MyGen<String> m2 = new MyGen<>();
					System.out.println(MyGen.count); //2		
				}
			}
			
	- Wildcard in Genrics
	
		Student s1= new Student();
		EnggStudent s2 = new EnggStudent();		
		s1=s2; // Work as expected Parent class can have reference of child class
		
		ArrayList<Student> al1 = new ArrayList<>();
		ArrayList<EnggStudent> al2 = new ArrayList<>();		
		al1=al2;  // Get compiler time error
		
		ArrayList<?> al1 = new ArrayList<>();	// assign any type to al1
		ArrayList<EnggStudent> al2 = new ArrayList<>();		
		al1=al2;  // Work as expected
		
		ArrayList<? extends Student> al1 = new ArrayList<>();	// Only Student and its desendent can assign to al1 (UPPER BOUND WILDCARD)
		ArrayList<EnggStudent> al2 = new ArrayList<>();		
		al1=al2;  // Work as expected
		
		ArrayList<? super Student> al1 = new ArrayList<>();	// Only Student and its ancestors can assign to al1 (LOWER BOUND WILDCARD)
		ArrayList<Object> al2 = new ArrayList<>();		
		al1=al2;  // Work as expected
		
Collection Interface
--------------------

	public interface Collection<E> extends Iterable<E>
	{
		int size();
		boolean isEmpty();
		boolean contains();
		boolean add(E e);
		boolean remove(Object 0);
		Iterator<E> iterator();
		Object toArray();
		T[] toArray(T[] arr);
		Stream<E> stream();
		Stream<E> parallelStream();
		
		// Bulk Operations
		// If source collection is modified, then bulk oprtions result is true otherwise false.
		boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
		boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
		boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)
		boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c)
		boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter)
	}
	
List
-----
	- The List interface provides a way to store the ordered collection. 
	- It is an ordered collection of objects in which duplicate values can be stored. 
	- Since List preserves the insertion order, it allows positional access and insertion of elements.	
	- Common Methods
		- We have a common interface present in the List interface. The below methods can be called on LinkedList, Vectors or ArrayList.
		- There are common implementations of below methods in the AbstractList class which is used by LinkedList and ArrayList.
			1) get(int index)	
				This method returns element at the specified index.
			2) set(int index, E element)	
				This method replaces element at given index with new element. This function returns the element which was just replaced by new element. Since it is a generic function, so "E" here is denotes the type of element in the List.
			3) indexOf(element)			
				This method returns the first occurrence of the given element or -1 if the element is not present in the list.
			4) listIterator()				
				List interface has an enhanced version of the iterator. The iterator in Collection interface allows us to traverse only in the forward direction, where as a List iterator is an ehnaced iterator and it allows us to traverse in both forward and backward directions.
			5) listIterator(int index)	
				This function returns an iterator pointing to the element at index "index".
			6) remove(int index)	
				This method removes an element from the specified index. It shifts subsequent elements(if any) to left and decreases their indexes by 1.
			7) remove(element)	
				This method is used to remove the first occurrence of the given element in the list.
			8) lastIndexOf(Object)
				The lastIndexOf() method of ArrayList returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element.
			9) clear()
				This method is simply used to clear an ArrayList by deleting all of its elements. It's return type is void and it doesn't return anything.
		
	ListIterator
	-------------
	- List interface has an enhanced version of the iterator. The iterator in Collection interface allows us to traverse only in the forward direction, where as a List iterator is an ehnaced iterator and it allows us to traverse in both forward and backward directions.
		- It works only with Lists like ArrayList, Vector, LinkedLists.
		- It is inherited from the Iterator interface. So, it includes all functionalities of the iterator interface.
		- In addition to next(), hashNext() and remove(), it provides the below methods:
			1) hasPrevious() - It is used to check if we have previous item for the item pointed by current iterator or not.
			2) previous() - It returns the previous element of the list, and moves the iterator one position back.
			3) add() - It is used to add an item while iterating through the List.
			4) set() - replaces the element returned by either next() or previous() with the specified element
			5) nextIndex() returns the index of the element that the next() method will return
			6) previousIndex() - returns the index of the element that the previous() method will return
			
	ArrayList
	---------
	- Like dynamic arrays in other languages, ArrayLists in Java also uses normal arrays internally to implement dynamic resizing.
	- In Java 1.8, it is claimed at different sources like StackOverflow and Wikipedia that Java pre-allocates space for 10 items and creates a new space of size 1.5 times instead of double when old space gets full.
	- The major advantage of ArrayLists is that it has all advantages that come with arrays because it internally uses Arrays. The two major advantages of arrays are:
		1) Cache Friendliness.
		2) Random access of elements.
	- The amortized time complexity of adding an element to the end of ArrayList(dynamic arrays) is O(1), however, the worst-case time complexity is still O(N). So, it is wiser to use Arrays over ArrayList if you know the number of elements you are going to store beforehand.
	
		// sort the ArrayList in ascending order
        al.sort(Comparator.naturalOrder());

        // sort the ArrayList in descending order
        al.sort(Comparator.reverseOrder());
		
		// Collections.reverse method takes a list as a parameter and reverse the list
        Collections.reverse(al);
	
		add(obj) --------> Amortized O(1)

		size()    -------
		isEmpty() -------  \____  Worst Case O(1)
		get()------------  /
		set() -----------

		contains()  ----------------  
		indexOf()   ----------------  \
		lastIndexOf()  -------------    ------ Worst Case O(N)
		remove() [both versions] ---  /
		add(index, obj)  -----------
		
	LinkedList
	----------
	- This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear data structure where every element is stored as a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses called nodes. It is rarely used in a production scenario but it has its own advantages. Basically it can be used in two particular cases:
		1) It can be used as an ArrayList when the list type operation is performed for eg, insertion, deletion, remove, etc. It implements all the functions of the List interface just like an ArrayList.
		2) It can be also be used as an ArrayDeque when queue or dequeue type of operations are performed, thus implementing the Deque interface.
	- Insert and delete operations in the LinkedList are less expensive even in the worst case due to the reference of the previous and next elements which is highly unlikely in the case of ArrayList and ArrayDeque which internally uses a resizable array.
	- Methods common to both LinkedList and ArrayList

		Method						Description
		add(E e)					This method Appends the specified element to the end of this list.
		add(int index, E element)	This method Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list.

		peekLast()		This method retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.	Returns Null
		
	Stack
	-----
	- The class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out. 
	- In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty, search, and peek.
	- The class can also be said to extend Vector and treats the class as a stack with the five mentioned functions. The class can also be referred to as the subclass of Vector.
	- Stack class in Java is a legacy class and inherits from Vector in Java. It is a thread-safe class and hence involves overhead when we do not need thread safety. It is recommended to use ArrayDeque for stack implementation as it is more efficient in a single-threaded environment.
	- Stack Functions:
		Method					Description	
		push(Object element)	Pushes an element on the top of the stack.
		pop()					Removes and returns the top element of the stack. An 'EmptyStackException' exception is thrown if we call pop() when the invoking stack is empty.	
		peek()					Returns the element on the top of the stack, but does not remove it.
		isEmpty()				It returns true if nothing is on the top of the stack. Else, returns false.	O(1)
		size()					This method is used to get the size of the Stack or the number of elements present in the Stack.
		
		
Queue
------
	- The Queue is used to insert elements at the end of the queue and removes from the beginning of the queue. It follows FIFO concept.
	- The Java Queue supports all methods of Collection interface including insertion, deletion etc.
	- LinkedList, ArrayBlockingQueue and PriorityQueue are the most frequently used implementations.
	- If any null operation is performed on BlockingQueues, NullPointerException is thrown.
	- The Queues which are available in java.util package are Unbounded Queues.
	- The Queues which are available in java.util.concurrent package are the Bounded Queues.
	- All Queues except the Deques supports insertion and removal at the tail and head of the queue respectively. The Deques support element insertion and removal at both ends.
	- What should be preferred ArrayDeque or LinkedList?
		- ArrayDeque is generally preferred because of its faster execution and cache-friendly nature.
		- The time complexity for adding and removing items in a LinkedList is O(1) for every worst case. But for ArrayDeque it is amortized O(1). This means that for few operations which require internal resize of the array, the time of operation might increase to O(n) or linear time.
		- Therefore, in general, ArrayDeque is faster but it doesn't guarantee a constant time complexity for every worst case. So unless and until a very individual or particular operation is concerned in real-time, ArrayDeque performs better than the LinkedList.
		
		Method			Description
		peek()			This method is used to view the head of queue without removing it. It returns Null if the queue is empty.
		offer(element)	This method is used to insert an element in the queue. This method is preferable to add() method since this method does not throws an exception when the capacity of the container is full since it returns false.
		poll()			This method removes and returns the head of the queue. It returns null if the queue is empty.
		element()		This method is similar to peek(). It throws NoSuchElementException when the queue is empty.
		add(element)	This method is used to add elements at the tail of queue. More specifically, at the last of linked-list if it is used, or according to the priority in case of priority queue implementation.
		remove()		This method removes and returns the head of the queue. It throws NoSuchElementException when the queue is empty.
